### üß† Overview
This project characterizes **high-frequency (64‚Äì256 Hz) electromyographic (EMG) components embedded in scalp EEG** during focal-to-bilateral tonic‚Äìclonic seizures (FBTCS).  
The aim is to determine whether these ‚Äúartifact‚Äù components can provide **supplementary biomarkers for seizure detection and lateralization**.

### Concept

High-frequency EMG activity that contaminates scalp EEG signals was re-evaluated as a physiological signal rather than a noise source.
By quantitatively comparing EEG-embedded EMG components with simultaneously recorded deltoid EMG, this study investigated how these high-frequency features reflect seizure-related muscle activity and how they can be used to detect and lateralize FBTCS.



### Key quantitative measures

- **Power spectral density (PSD) correlation**

Compute PSD correlations between EEG and deltoid EMG, confirming that high-frequency components in the EEG originate from muscle activity.

- **Cross-correlation of RMS envelopes**

Assess temporal similarity between EEG-embedded EMG and deltoid EMG signals.

- **Integrated RMS (iRMS)** and **10‚Äì90 % rise slope**
Quantify tonic contraction strength and rate during head deviation.


### Clinical relevance

- **Seizure detection**

The high-frequency components embedded in scalp EEG showed a strong similarity to deltoid EMG activity, indicating that these signals represent seizure-related muscle activation characteristic of FBTCS.
This finding suggests that high-frequency EEG components can be used to quantitatively detect the occurrence of generalized tonic‚Äìclonic activity from EEG alone.

- **Lateralization**

Both iRMS and rise slope values were consistently higher on the ipsiversive side (the direction of head deviation), providing an objective electrophysiological marker for lateralization.

All scripts are designed for **open, safe, and patient-free** analysis and reproduce the procedures used for Figures 2‚Äì5 of the manuscript.
